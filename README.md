# AVL-Tree-Song
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This AVL Tree works by taking in a CSV file which contains a list of songs consisting of the songs title, writer, and year produced and organizes the infromation into the AVL tree.
The project was created using the Object-Oriented-Programming paradigm. 
The main class contains a simple user interface with a total of 9 options to test the program.

## Extra Infromation 
- Comments are included into the project detailing how every aspect of the AVL tree works.
- Aspects besides the AVLTree (such as the other classes in the project) are also detailed with comments.
- When typing the name of the song make sure to not include any spaces in the front or the end of the songs name (this is something im eventually trying to fix in the future to avoid any major inconveniences.)
